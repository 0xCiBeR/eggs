### How to Add Mods

**TODO**

### Recommended Egg Modifications

The following are highly recommended variable modifications you can make to the egg after importing it to your panel.

#### Define Host Registered Bind Address

Due to a current behavior of Pterodactyl, `SERVER_IP` will not return the node's public IP address if it is behind a NAT; it will return its private IP address. Unfortunately at this time, Arma Reforger **requires** the server's public IP address to be strictly defined within `config.json`. If you know your node is behind a NAT (or you are finding your node's private IP address being added to `config.json`), you will need to edit this egg after importing it by following these steps:

1. As a panel admin, find and open the egg within your Nests tab.
2. On the first tab, "Configuration", find the "Configuration Files" box under the "Process Management" section.
3. Carefully (as to not touch anything else), find `{{server.build.default.ip}}` and replace it with your node's public IP address. If done correctly, the line should now look something like this:

```json
"    \"gameHostRegisterBindAddress\"": "    \"gameHostRegisterBindAddress\": \"123.4.56.789\",",
```

#### Restrict Max Players

If you would like to restrict the maximum number of players that can join your client's server, you can change the permissions of the "Max Players" variable so that clients can only view this value (and not edit it). It's default value can also be changed, or the value can be changed on a server-by-server basis as desired.
