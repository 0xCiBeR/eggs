## Description
Space Engineers is a voxel-based sandbox game set in space and on planets.

**NOTE**
Because of the winetricks installation, the install process could take some time. Likewise, the first start of the server takes its time.

When installed, the Server loads a base World and config from this repo. New world must be generated with the Windows Dedicated Server and then uploaded to the /config/Saves folder.
Everything which is not defined in a variable could be edited directy in the config file /config/SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg and config/Saves/{{WORLD}}/Sandbox.sbc
