### From their [Github](https://github.com/Tarnadas/net64plus-server) page  
Net64 aka SM64O allows playing Super Mario 64 in an online multiplayer mode. Net64+ is the official continuation of the program and features an integrated server list.  

### Install notes
Due to rate limiting the console on the panel cannot keep up with the game console and the build will complete before the panel console may show it. Reloading the console will load it to the latest part of the log.

### Server Ports
A single port is required to run this server.

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 3678    |

#### Mods/Plugins may require ports to be added to the server.
